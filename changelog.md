# Changelog

## 0.0.1

The target for 0.0.1 is just a basic read-only module that will likely have some cmdlets that don't make much sense as I'm pretty much just iterating through all the api endpoints, copy-pasting a file and making tiny adjustments. Future versions will be more useful.

See [setup-test-environment.ps1](setup-test-environment.ps1) for how to use this module in your scripts the way I do.
